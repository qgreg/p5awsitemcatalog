Provisioning a Webserver
========================

This project uses the application developed in Project 3 to configure a web server to deplay the appliation. Using a virtual server in Amazonâ€™s Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), the web server runs a stack of Linux, Apache, PostgreSQL and Python to serve and run the application. 

While the project is available during grading, this is the project's URL:
http://ec2-52-27-221-22.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/

*Configuring the Server* details the steps taken to confure the server and provides source references for the steps taken.

### Exceeding Specifications
The project seeks to exceed specifications by implementing the following.
1. Fail2ban monitors for repeat unsuccessful login attempts and appropriately bans attackers.
2. *** automatically manages package updates
3. Glances provides automatic feedback on appliation availability status.
Details on these features are included in *Configuring the Server*.


Configuring the Server
----------------------

### Helpful tips

Always have two terminal windows open. When you test changes you have made, this can help you keep from being locked out.

## Logging on to the Instance

1. Download Private Key from the Udacity website
2. Move the private key file into the folder ~/.ssh (where ~ is your environment's home directory). So if you downloaded the file to the Downloads folder, just execute the following command in your terminal.
```
mv ~/Downloads/udacity_key.rsa ~/.ssh/
```
3. Open your terminal and type in
```
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa
```
In your terminal, type in
```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/udacity_key.rsa root@52.11.199.213
```

## Adding New User
To add the user grader:
```
sudo adduser grader
```
Adduser requires a passworda and allows for user optional information.

Reference: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud299-nd/l-4331066009/m-4801089468


## Giving grader sudo access

To add sduo access, create the following file and add the language below:
```
touch /etc/sudoers.d/grader
sudo nano /etc/sudoers.d/grader
```
Add the following line to the file /etc/sudoers.d/grader:
```
grader ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
Save and close nano.

Reference: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud299-nd/l-4331066009/m-4801089471


## Securing New User

Switch your user to grader
```
su grader
```
Go to the home directory
```
cd
```
Make a .ssh directory
```
mkdir .ssh
```
Create a key locally.
```
ssh-keygen
```
Provide a password for the key file. Save the file locally in the home .ssh file. Copy the key from your local file to the file /home/grader/.ssh/authorized_keys

Put property security in place:
```
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Disable remote root login and enforce key-based authentication

Edit the configuration file:
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Change the PermitRootLogin and PasswordAuthentication as follows:
```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
```

## Configure Firewall

```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp
sudo ufw allow www
sudo ufw allow ntp
```
Check your work with:
```
sudo ufw show added
```

Once you have confirmed that the configuration is correct, start the firewall:
```
sudo ufw enable
```

## Monitoring Unsuccessful Logins

Install fail2ban
```
sudo apt-get install fail2ban
```
Edit configuration
```
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```
Add the following actions:
```
[ssh]
enabled = true
banaction = ufw-ssh
port = 2992
filter = sshd
logpath = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3


[apache]
enabled = true
port = http,https
banaction = ufw-apache
filter = apache-auth
logpath = /var/log/apache*/error*.log
maxretry = 4


[apache-filenotfound]
enabled = true
port = http,https
banaction = ufw-apache
filter = apache-nohome
logpath = /var/log/apache*/error*.log
maxretry = 3


[apache-noscript]
enabled = true
port = http,https
banaction = ufw-apache
filter = apache-noscript
logpath = /var/log/apache*/error*.log
maxretry = 6


[apache-overflows]
enabled = true
port = http,https
banaction = ufw-apache
filter = apache-overflows
logpath = /var/log/apache*/error*.log
maxretry = 2
```
Create banaction files
```
sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-ssh.conf
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-ssh.conf
```
Edit the file:
```
[Definition]
actionstart =
actionstop =
actioncheck =
actionban = ufw insert 1 deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH
actionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip> to any app OpenSSH
```
Secondly:
```
sudo touch /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-apache.conf
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/action.d/ufw-apache.conf
```
Edit the file:
```
[Definition]
actionstart =
actionstop =
actioncheck =
actionban = ufw insert 2 deny from <ip> to any app "Apache Full"
actionunban = ufw delete deny from <ip> to any app "Apache Full"
```

## Install logwatch

Logwatch can allow you to monitor the server's logs.
```
sudo apt-get install logwatch
sudo apt-get install mailutils
```

Full admission: I struggled a bit with logwatch and postfix. I finally configured logwatch to send to root, but I'm not sure I could repeat the configuration. The current configuration includes copying the debian configuration to main.cf.
```
sudo cp /usr/share/postfix/main.cf.debian /etc/postfix/main.cf
```
You also need to make sure there are proper aliases:
```
sudo newaliases
```
Start postfix.
```
sudo /etc/init.d/postfix start
```
To view yesterday's logs:
```
sudo logwatch
```
To view logs in root mail:
```
sudo mail
```

## Importing Database Elements from existing Heroku deployment 

I used a backup from my heroku deployment to import the structure of the database from my app there.

## PostgreSQL Remote Connections

Confirm that the default configuration does not allow remote connections by reviewing the configuration file.
```
sudo nano /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf 
```


## Limited permission for PostgreSQL user Catalog

After the database was imported, I created two roles:
catalog_crud, having select, update, insert and delete permissions to all tables;
catalog_connect, having connection permissions to the database.
Having created the needed tables, I altered the tables to be owned by catalog and I granted user catalog no createDB permissions. I also granted catalog_crud and catalog_connect to catalog.
